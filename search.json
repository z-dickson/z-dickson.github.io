    "text": "The Limits of Partisan Motivated Reasoning in Congress\nwith Tevfik Murat Yildirim (under review)\nAbstract: Downplaying the level of risk associated with COVID-19—along with opposition to public health measures aimed at containing the virus—became a rallying cry for certain legislators in the US Congress throughout the pandemic. Yet, to what degree are elites ``blind partisans,” willing to take on the positions of their parties regardless of potential consequences? In this article, we argue that elites’ strategic motivations transcend partisan motivated reasoning when individuals realize a risk that is otherwise misperceived. We demonstrate our argument in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic by examining the effects of COVID-19 infection on opposition to COVID-19 mitigation policies among United States’ legislators. After training a large language model to identify opposition messages from legislators, we adopt a staggered difference-in-difference design and use both Bayesian and frequentist perspectives to illustrate that COVID-19 infection caused a reduction of around 32 percent in legislators’ expressed opposition to measures aimed at reducing the spread of COVID-19. Our findings highlight the limits of partisan motivated reasoning for an issue as salient as COVID-19 and in elites as polarized as US Members of Congress.\n\nSocial class and representation: The effects of socialization on MPs’ responsiveness\n(Revise and resubmit)\nAbstract: It is an increasingly obvious conclusion that government is more responsive to higher class voters. Such findings are deeply problematic for conceptions of equal democratic representation, but we still have limited understanding of the various mechanisms driving unequal responsiveness. In this article, I argue that representatives’ educational socialization affects how they respond to the working class. I apply this argument in the context of the United Kingdom’s House of Commons by focusing on representatives’ communication from 2017–2021. Using an original dataset that combines 151 repeated public opinion surveys, as well as representatives’ communication online and in parliament, I show that MPs educated at one of the two Oxbridge Universities – Oxford and Cambridge – are more responsive to the middle class while simultaneously less responsive to the working class in relation to MPs with other educational backgrounds. The results of the article contribute to literature on descriptive (mis-)representation as a driver of unequal responsiveness to working class voters.\nYouth Suffrage and Legislative Responsiveness to Climate Change: Evidence from Scotland\nwith Tevfik Murat Yildirim (under review)\nSlide presentation – 2022 ECPR Joint Sessions\nAbstract: While the vast majority of countries around the world require that voters be 18 years of age to cast a ballot, advocates of extending the franchise to include individuals aged 16 and over point to greater engagement, and countries that have lowered the voting age to 16 have witnessed increased political participation compared to some older groups. While a handful of studies have looked at the effects of lowering the voting age to 16 on political knowledge or participation, we have almost no understanding of how youth enfranchisement influences legislative behavior. In this article, we adopt a quasi-experimental design and the synthetic control method to examine legislative responsiveness following 2014 legislation that lowered the minimum voting age from 18 to 16 in Scotland. Analysis of 1.8 million legislative speeches from the House of Commons and the Scottish Parliament over the course of two decades indicates that lowering the voting age had only marginal effects on legislative responsiveness to younger voters. We conclude that enfranchisement of 16- and 17 year-olds does not go far enough to address a lack of substantive representation of young people.\nWho Sets the Agenda? Legislative Responsiveness to NGOs, Corporations and the Media\nFull draft available on SSRN\nAbstract: Who holds power in a representative democracy can be identified by determining who sets the political agenda. Yet, competing for political attention is no easy task as MPs are recipient to constant demands from all different directions. In this article, I explore the degree to which parliamentarians are responsive to media organizations, multinational corporations and NGOs on a number of issues using social media data from Twitter. Using a new dataset of over two million tweets, issue attention to different issues is identified and measured using a temporal content analysis approach that relies on semi-supervised machine learning. Vector autoregression (VAR) models are then fitted to capture the extent to which a shift in issue attention from one actor (at t − 1) predicts a shift in another actor’s attention (at t). Findings reveal broad support for the agenda-setting influence of the media and corporations in British politics.\nAre Women Representatives More Responsive to Women’s Issue Priorities?\nSlide presentation – MPSA 2022\nAbstract: Despite a long list of normative benefits associated with increasing the number of women in parliament, past studies have primarily characterized the benefits women’s descriptive representation in terms of the benefits it brings to women constituents. Focusing on issue congruence in the United States and the United Kingdom, this article argues and demonstrates that women are not only more congruent with women constituents, they are also more congruent than than their male colleagues with the issue priorities of the national electorate. Using a new dataset of every public message sent on Twitter by British and American representatives between 2018 and 2022, as well as over 350 repeated public opinion surveys, I examines dynamic congruence between representatives’ expressed interests online and the issues that are important to their constituents. The findings challenge the idea that women constituents are the sole beneficiaries of an increased female presence in politics and illustrate that group representation is far from a zero-sum game.\n\nOther words\nAcademic:\n\nPhD Thesis slides\n\nNon-academic:\n\nSo Hormonal. 2020.
