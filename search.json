Elite Cues and Non-compliance\nwith Sara B Hobolt (R&R - APSR)\nSlide presentation – 2023 PolMeth Europe\nAbstract: As political leaders increasingly use social media to speak directly to voters, the degree to which elite cues influence public behavior is of great importance. In this paper, we study the effects of elite cues on non-compliant behavior during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, focusing on a series of controversial tweets sent by US President Donald Trump calling for the ``liberation’’ of Minnesota, Virginia and Michigan from state and local government COVID-19 restrictions. Leveraging the fact that Trump’s messages referred to three specific US states, we adopt a generalized difference-in-difference approach relying on spatial and temporal variation to identify the causal effects of the targeted cues. Our analysis finds that the President’s messages led to an increase in movement, a decrease in adherence to stay-at-home restrictions, and an increase in arrests of white Americans for crimes related to civil disobedience. These findings highlight the capacity of political elites to motivate non-compliant and even criminal behavior.\n6. Going against the Grain: Climate Change as a Wedge Issue for the Radical Right\nwith Sara B Hobolt (R&R - CPS)\nAbstract: In search of electoral gains, political parties mobilize issues to divide existing coalitions. We argue that by adopting a distinctively adversarial stance, radical right-wing parties have increasingly politicized climate change policies as a wedge issue. This strategy challenges the mainstream party consensus and seeks to mobilize voter concerns over green initiatives. Relying on state-of-the-art multilingual language models, we empirically examine nearly half a million press releases from 82 political parties across 9 European democracies to support this argument. Our findings demonstrate that the radical right’s oppositional climate policy rhetoric diverges significantly from the mainstream consensus. Survey data further reveals climate policy skepticism among voters across the political spectrum, highlighting the mobilizing potential of climate policies as a wedge issue. This research advances our understanding of issue competition and the politicization of climate change.\n5. Elite Responsiveness to Policy Shocks: Insights from COVID-19 Infection among US Congressmembers\nwith Tevfik Murat Yildirim\n(R&R submitted - Political Communication)\nSlide presentation – 2023 MPSA\nAbstract: Elites’ skepticism of scientific consensus presents a formidable challenge in addressing critical issues like climate change and global pandemics. While extensive research has explored the capacity of events related to these challenges to act as ``exogenous shocks,’’ motivating the general public to reassess their risk perceptions, our understanding of how elites similarly respond to such shocks remains limited. In this article, we investigate the extent to which COVID-19 infections influence lawmakers’ support for COVID-19 containment measures, focusing on expressed opposition to COVID-19 policies on social media and in press releases throughout the first two years of the pandemic. Employing a staggered difference-in-difference design, our analysis reveals that COVID-19 infections caused a reduction of approximately 30% in legislators’ expressions of opposition to COVID-19 policies. These findings underscore that elites are indeed responsive to policy shocks, even in highly polarized contexts, when they are personally affected by the issue.\n4. The Gender Gap in Elite-Voter Responsiveness Online\n(R&R - Perspectives on Politics)\nAbstract: The extent to which women’s descriptive representation furthers the substantive representation of women have been demonstrated in countless contexts. Yet, we know less about how female representatives act as individuals to respond to the changing priorities of the electorate. In this article, I examine representatives’ dynamic responsiveness to public issue priorities in the United States and United Kingdom. After combining hundreds of repeated public opinion surveys asking voters about their issue priorities, I train a large language model to classify the universe of representatives’ social media messages on Twitter to the same issues. Findings of the analysis illustrate that women’s issue priorities receive less attention from representatives in aggregate in both countries, that female representatives are more responsive than their male colleagues to women’s priorities in both countries, and that a gender gap similarly exists in responsiveness to men’s issue priorities, with women leading the way in both countries. Results provide further evidence of the link between descriptive and substantive representation and suggest that women representatives may even go beyond furthering ``women’s interests’’ by displaying greater dynamic responsiveness in a broad sense.\n3. Elite Legislators and Unequal Representation in the UK\nOSF preprint\nSlide presentation – 2023 PSA Parliaments\nWorking Paper\nAbstract: Studies identifying inequality in political representation in liberal democracies have become increasingly common. Yet, the extent to which this deficit is driven by the social class of elected representatives remains unclear. In this article, I study the effects of social class on legislative responsiveness in the United Kingdom by utilizing MPs’ attendance at one of the two Oxbridge universities – Oxford and Cambridge – as an encompassing proxy for social class. After combining 284 repeated public opinion surveys and classifying the universe of MPs’ questions and motions in the House of Commons from 2015-2023, I present evidence from multiple designs and estimation strategies that suggests that social class indeed constrains responsiveness. The results quantify unequal responsiveness in the United Kingdom and contribute to the literature on inequality in political representation.\n2. Youth Suffrage and Legislative Responsiveness to Climate Change: Evidence from Scotland\nwith Tevfik Murat Yildirim\nSlide presentation – 2022 ECPR Joint Sessions\nWorking Paper\nAbstract: While the vast majority of countries around the world require that voters be 18 years of age to cast a ballot, advocates of extending the franchise to include individuals aged 16 and over point to greater engagement, and countries that have lowered the voting age to 16 have witnessed increased political participation compared to some older groups. While a handful of studies have looked at the effects of lowering the voting age to 16 on political knowledge or participation, we have almost no understanding of how youth enfranchisement influences legislative behavior. In this article, we adopt a quasi-experimental design and the synthetic control method to examine legislative responsiveness following 2014 legislation that lowered the minimum voting age from 18 to 16 in Scotland. Analysis of 1.8 million legislative speeches from the House of Commons and the Scottish Parliament over the course of two decades indicates that lowering the voting age had only marginal effects on legislative responsiveness to younger voters. We conclude that enfranchisement of 16- and 17 year-olds does not go far enough to address a lack of substantive representation of young people.\n1. The Relative Online Influence of NGOs, Corporations and the Media\nSSRN\nWorking Paper\nAbstract: It is well-established that various actors compete to draw the attention of politicians to issues they view as important. Yet, given the numerous channels through which different actors attempt to influence the political agenda, we know less about the relative influence of these different actors. This article examines the degree to which non-governmental organizations (NGOs), multinational corporations (MNCs) and top UK media organizations influence the issue attention of parliamentarians in the UK House of Commons on the same playing field – social media. Using a dataset that includes the universe of social media messages from the top-100 British MNCs and NGOs, top British media organizations, and messages sent by elected MPs, I rely on Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods to measure the dynamic attention of each actor to different salient issues. After creating and validating an issue dictionary based on semi-supervised machine learning, I use vector autoregression (VAR) models to estimate the relative influence that each actor has on MPs’ issue attention online. Findings reveal broad support for the influence of the media and corporations.\n\nOther words\nAcademic:\n\nDSI Research Showcase - COVID-19 and Congress\nPhD Thesis slides\nJohn Smith Centre Blog: MPs’ Gender and Responsiveness in the House of Commons\n\nNon-academic:\n\nSo Hormonal. 2020.
