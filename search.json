    "text": "I’m currently a postdoctoral research fellow at the London School of Economics and Political Science on the COVIDEU project. I’m also affiliated with the  LSE Data Science Institute.   My research focuses on social identity, elites and political representation. Broadly, I’m interested in legislative communication, behavior and responsiveness. Most of my current research applies computational and causal inference methods to study elites’ behavior in relation to public opinion. You can find out more about some of my current research projects here.\n\nPrior to my doctoral research at the University of Glasgow, I earned a masters in international relations at the University of Edinburgh and a bachelor’s degree in political science at Northeastern Illinois University in my hometown of Chicago.\nA copy of my CV can be downloaded  here."
